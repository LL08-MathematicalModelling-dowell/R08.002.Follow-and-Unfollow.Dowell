Step 1 : Start with queue of 45 thousand profiles and n(90) identities 
Step 2 : Assign 1st n profiles in the queue to n identities 
Step 3 : After some time check which identity have completed its task (following assigned profile) then assign next profile in a queue to that identity.
         (Each identity will get 45000/n number of profiles to follow) 
Step 4 : Repeat step 3 till all profiles get followed by any one identity
Step 5 : Do this whole procedure 10 times(no. may vary) under the constraint that one profile should come to one identity only at once to get 10 different followers to all profiles
         (In total one identity will follow (45000/n)*10 profiles)
