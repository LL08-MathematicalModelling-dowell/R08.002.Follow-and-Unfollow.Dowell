Step 1 : Start with queue of 45 thousand profiles and n identities 
Step 2 : Assign 1st n profiles to n identities 
Step 3 : After some time check which identity have completed its task (following assigned profile) then assign next profile in queue to that identity
Step 4 : Repeat step 3 till all profiles get followed by identity
Step 5 : Do this whole procedure 10 times(no. may vary) under the constraint that one profile should come to one identity only at once to get 10 different followers to all profiles
